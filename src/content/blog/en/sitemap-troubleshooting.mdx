You conscientiously submitted your sitemap.  
Yet, the Search Console indexing graph remains flat.  
It's that agonizing period where you start wondering, “Is Google just ignoring me?”

Funny thing is, this situation is quite common.  
The causes range from deceptively simple to frustratingly complex.  
Knowing these cases will save you from the futile cycle of deleting and re-submitting your sitemap.

## What This Article Covers

- The real reasons why crawling or indexing fails despite sitemap submission.
- Where to look within Google Search Console.
- What constitutes a “normal” waiting period for new websites.

<br/>

## 0. Confirm Your Current Status First

Let’s clear up a few misconceptions.

1. <strong>Search Console → Indexing → Sitemaps</strong>  
   - Status: Is it “Success,” “Couldn’t fetch,” or “Read error”?  
   - “Last read” date: Is it recent or stuck in the past?

2. <strong>Search Console → Indexing → Pages</strong>  
   - Are the URLs in your sitemap grouped as:  
     - “Discovered – currently not indexed”?  
     - “Crawled – currently not indexed”?  
     - Or entirely missing from the list?

Usually, the situation falls into one of these three patterns:

- <strong>Pattern A</strong>: Sitemap status is OK; pages are mostly “Discovered” → Google knows the URLs but has postponed crawling.
- <strong>Pattern B</strong>: “Couldn’t fetch” or “Read error” → Issues with access or the sitemap file format.
- <strong>Pattern C</strong>: Only a few pages indexed; most are quiet → A mix of quality, priority, and crawl budget issues.

Now, let’s break down the causes.

<br/>

## 1. When the Sitemap File Itself is the Problem

First, suspect if your sitemap is truly a <strong>“standard XML”</strong> file.

Common failures:

- XML syntax errors: unclosed tags or BOM issues.
- Redirecting to HTML or serving HTML instead of XML.
- Responding with 3xx/4xx/5xx instead of a 200 OK status.
- Invalid domain or path submission (e.g., staging domain or local paths).

How to check:

- Open `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml` directly in a browser.
- Ensure the `Content-Type` header is `application/xml` or `text/xml`.
- Use an XML validator tool to verify the format.
- Check the Sitemap details in Search Console for specific error messages like “HTTP error” or “Incorrect XML.”

On platforms like GitHub Pages, path casing (`sitemap.xml` vs `Sitemap.xml`) can often cause issues. Additionally, ensure your CDN/WAF layers aren't serving different responses to Googlebot.

<br/>

## 2. When robots.txt or noindex Blocks the Sitemap

A frustratingly common oversight.

- <strong>robots.txt</strong> is blocking the entire site.
- Pages possess a `noindex` tag but are still included in the sitemap.

Example scenario:
```txt
User-agent: *  
Disallow: /  

Sitemap: https://example.com/sitemap.xml  
```
In this scenario, you’ve basically said, <strong>“Here is my sitemap,”</strong> but followed it up with, <strong>“don’t you dare enter.”</strong>

What to check:

- In `https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt`:  
  - Ensure `Disallow: /` isn't blocking everything.  
  - Ensure no `Disallow` rule specific to `/sitemap.xml` exists.  
- Open a few representational URLs from the sitemap and check for `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">`.  
- Check if your canonical tags point elsewhere (indexing duplicate content).

It's very common to forget to remove `noindex` or `Disallow` rules used during development when moving to production.

<br/>

## 3. New Site + Low Trust + Just a Matter of Time

It might be a letdown, but often <strong>“it hasn't been seen yet, but it’s not broken.”</strong>

Typical scenarios:

- A completely new domain.
- Near-zero external links and minimal brand searches.
- Dozens of pages created all at once in the last 1–2 weeks.

In these cases, you’ll see:

- Sitemap status: Success.
- Pages: “Discovered – currently not indexed” accumulates.
- Last read date updates, but indexing graphs don't move.

General SEO experience suggests:

- For a new site, a 10-day wait after submission is often considered <strong>“within normal processing limits.”</strong>
- It can take weeks or months if content volume is low and links are sparse.

If it’s been 3 days: it’s likely normal. If 3–4 weeks pass and even core pages haven’t moved: it’s time to investigate other causes.

<br/>

## 4. Including Too Many 'Low-Value' URLs in the Sitemap

A sitemap is a signal of <strong>“vital”</strong> URLs. Mixing in low-quality or ambiguous links dilutes that signal.

Examples:

- Internal search results or filter URLs (?sort=, ?page=, etc.).
- Nearly empty tag, category, or archive pages.
- Non-indexable pages like login, cart, or user profiles.
- Soft-404 pages (empty pages returning 200 OK).

The outcome:

- Most URLs end up as <strong>“Crawled – currently not indexed”</strong> or simply “Not indexed.”
- Trust in your sitemap’s overall quality decreases.

Clean-up steps:

- Remove non-indexable URLs from the sitemap.
- Merge thin content pages or set them to `noindex` and exclude them.
- Only keep URLs in the sitemap that you truly want to appear in search results.

Prioritize quality over quantity. Fifty well-curated pages move faster than 1,000 generic ones.

<br/>

## 5. Crawl Budget Reduced by Server Speed or Errors

Googlebot is a visitor that consumes resources. If your server is unstable, it will visit less frequently.

Major issues:

- Excessive <strong>TTFB</strong> (Time to First Byte), often slower for bots.
- Frequent 5xx errors (500, 502, 503).
- Intermittent timeouts for the sitemap or internal URLs.

Monitoring indicators:

- Spikes in average response time in Search Console → Settings → Crawl Stats.
- Frequent “HTTP error” or “Couldn't fetch” in Sitemap reports.
- Server logs showing error patterns during Googlebot visits.

Solutions:

- Improve caching (CDN, reverse proxy, app-level cache).
- Upgrade server specs relative to traffic.
- Ensure WAF/security settings don't block Googlebot.

A perfect sitemap won't help if your server is sluggish; Google will simply decide to <strong>“visit later.”</strong>

<br/>

## 6. Conflicts in Sitemap Path, Format, or Caching

Sometimes you submit a sitemap, but Google isn't seeing the latest version.

Typical cases:

- Dual sitemaps (`/sitemap.xml` and `/sitemap_index.xml`) existing separately.
- Conflicts between different CMS SEO plugins.
- Caching plugins serving old XML versions to bots.

Recommendations:

- Establish <strong>one official</strong> sitemap URL (e.g., `https://example.com/sitemap_index.xml`).
- Disable redundant sitemap generators.
- Set sitemap paths as cache exceptions to ensure the XML is always fresh.

<br/>

## 7. Weak Internal Link Structure

A sitemap is a companion to your site’s architecture, not a replacement. Google still prioritizes internal linking.

The problem:

- The sitemap has URLs, but nothing links to them on the actual site.
- Orphan pages that are intended for ads but have no navigation links.

From Google’s perspective: <strong>“It’s in the index, but it’s never mentioned in the book.”</strong>

Improvement steps:

- Fix core links in the menu, footer, or sidebar.
- Naturally link to related services or articles within the body text.
- Ensure clear hierarchies (Category → Post) to eliminate orphan pages.

The sitemap says <strong>“this exists,”</strong> internal links say <strong>“this is useful.”</strong> You need both.

<br/>

## 8. Sitemap Read, Status: Under Evaluation

The most common situation.

You feel the sitemap isn't being read, but in reality, it was read, and the URLs are simply under evaluation.

The signs:

- Sitemap report: Success, “Last read” is recent.
- Page report: “Discovered – currently not indexed” persists.

This means: Google knows the URLs but doesn't find them <strong>“valuable enough to index immediately.”</strong>

Resubmitting the sitemap won't help here. Instead:

- Manually request indexing for the top 10–20 core URLs.
- Enhance content (unique insights, real cases, FAQs, images).
- Increase internal/external links to signal page importance.

<br/>

## Checklist for Action

<strong>Phase 1: Technical Check (30–60 mins)</strong>

- Verify Sitemap status in Search Console.
- Open the XML in a browser to check headers and status codes.
- Audit robots.txt and firewalls for bot blockages.

<strong>Phase 2: Sitemap Optimization (1–2 days)</strong>

- Remove low-value URLs (parameters, thin content).
- Unify sitemap paths and set cache exceptions.

<strong>Phase 3: Content and Structure Refinement (1–3 days)</strong>

- Strengthen content on core indexable pages.
- Improve internal link navigation to eliminate orphan pages.
- Review server performance and logs.

<strong>Phase 4: Monitoring (1–4 weeks)</strong>

- Manually request indexing for core updates.
- Monitor reports weekly.
- Build natural external mentions/links.

<br/>

## One-Line Summary

- A sitemap is a <strong>“hint,”</strong> not a <strong>“guarantee.”</strong>  
- Silence for a few days is normal; silence for weeks usually indicates one of these 8 causes.

Stop the loop of deleting and resubmitting; check your technicals once, then spend your time on content and links.
