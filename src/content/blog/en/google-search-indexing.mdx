The site opens perfectly.  
But on Google? It's as if you don't exist.  
It's a bit of a reality check for any new owner.

In fact, this situation is quite common.  
Especially when Search Console displays <strong>“Discovered – currently not indexed.”</strong>  
Don't panic; just follow the sequence.

## What This Article Covers

- Step-by-step checklist for when a new site doesn't appear on Google.  
- How to interpret Search Console statuses like <strong>“Discovered”</strong> and <strong>“Crawled – currently not indexed.”</strong>  
- Practical steps in setup, content, and linking to accelerate indexing.

<br/>

## The Process At a Glance

1. Distinguishing between <strong>“Pre-Indexing”</strong> and <strong>“Just Not Visible”</strong>  
2. Checking basic blockages like robots, noindex, or private settings  
3. Verifying Search Console registration and authentication  
4. Auditing Sitemap (sitemap.xml) and core URL submissions  
5. Inspecting <strong>“Discovered – currently not indexed”</strong> pages  
6. Reviewing content quality, duplication, and thin content issues  
7. Organizing internal link structures and crawl paths  
8. Testing server response speeds and errors (4xx, 5xx)  
9. Building small-scale external links or mentions  
10. Re-requesting indexing and creating a monitoring routine  

Checking these from top to bottom will clarify <strong>“what you need to do next.”</strong>

<br/>

## 1. Confirm If It’s Actually Not Indexed

The first task is to clear up any misunderstandings.

- Type `site:example.com` into the Google search bar.  
  - If nothing appears → Likely pre-indexing.  
  - If a few results show up → It’s not <strong>“completely unlisted,”</strong> but rather an exposure/ranking issue.  
- Search for your domain (brand name) and see if at least the home page appears.  

It’s simple, but this stage defines your path.

- New domain + zero results → <strong>“Pre-indexing or early stage.”</strong>  
- Some pages visible → <strong>“Indexing in progress”</strong> + possible quality/priority issues.  

Instead of a vague <strong>“It’s not on Google,”</strong> distinguish between <strong>“Zero Indexing vs. Partial Indexing”</strong> to begin proper recovery.

<br/>

## 2. Check for Robots, Noindex, or Private Settings

A common plot twist.

- A `noindex` tag left over from the development phase.  
- A CMS (e.g., WordPress) setting like <strong>“Discourage search engines from indexing this site”</strong> is checked.  

Checkpoints:

- Does `robots.txt` have `Disallow: /`, blocking the entire site?  
- Is there a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` tag in the `<head>` of problem pages?  
- Are you expecting indexing for pages behind a password or login?  

This takes 5 minutes to check but can be the culprit for months of indexing failure.

<br/>

## 3. Ensure Search Console is Registered and Authenticated

From Google's perspective, <strong>“sites registered in Search Console”</strong> are much easier to handle than those with zero settings.

What to check:

- Is the HTTPS version of the domain registered as a property?  
  - e.g., `https://example.com`  
- Is ownership verification successfully completed?  
- Is data appearing in the Indexing > Pages report?  

Lacking Search Console is like visiting a hospital without a doctor. It’s the tool that tells you where it hurts.

<br/>

## 4. Audit Sitemap (sitemap.xml) and Core URL Submissions

![A digital data bridge connecting a website to Google's data infrastructure](/images/google_search_indexing_bridge_digital_v2_1770861607948.png)

Google finds pages by following links, but a Sitemap serves as your <strong>“Table of Contents.”</strong>

- Verify if `https://example.com/sitemap.xml` opens correctly.  
- Ensure `sitemap.xml` is submitted under Search Console → Indexing → Sitemaps.  
- Check if the submission status is <strong>“Success”</strong> or has errors/warnings.  

It’s also beneficial to manually submit a few critical pages.

- Search Console → URL Inspection → Enter page address.  
- If <strong>“URL is not on Google,”</strong> click <strong>“Request Indexing.”</strong>  

This single action can lead to indexing within a day or two. You don't need to do this for every single page.

<br/>

## 5. Inspect “Discovered – Currently Not Indexed” Status

The critical section. This is the most common message for new sites.

Google’s explanation summarized:

- Google <strong>knows</strong> the URL (found via Sitemap or links).  
- But it hasn’t <strong>crawled</strong> it yet or is postponing it.  
- Reasons includes crawl budget, server load, or estimated page quality.  

What you can do:

- Pick only truly vital pages for URL Inspection → Request Indexing.  
- Ensure these pages aren't <strong>“isolated”</strong> within the site.  
  - Are they linked via menus, footers, or body text?  

<strong>“Discovered”</strong> itself isn't a bug; it's a status. The problem is when this status persists for too long.

<br/>

## 6. Review Content Quality, Duplication, and Thin Content

Keywords repeated in Google's official and unofficial explanations is <strong>“Quality.”</strong>

- Dozens of repetitive pages with similar content.  
- Thin content: low word count with almost no useful information.  
- Automated generation or raw translations with repetitive phrasing.  

Google has no reason to prioritize indexing such pages.  

Actions to take:

- Merge pages with near-identical content into one.  
- Add <strong>“unique information”</strong> like real cases, numbers, screenshots, or FAQs to core pages.  
- Set tags/category list pages to `noindex` or keep them minimal.  

Ten well-written articles beat one hundred five-line posts in both indexing and traffic.

<br/>

## 7. Organize Internal Link Structure and Crawl Paths

Googlebots travel via links.

- Is every important page linked from at least one internal location?  
- Is there a natural hierarchy like Home → Category → Detail Page?  
- Is page depth too extreme? (Pages requiring 5+ clicks).  

Typical issues:

- Blog posts exist but have few links to categories, tags, or recommended articles.  
- New landing pages created for ads have zero internal links.  
- Even the footer lacks links to key pages, making them <strong>“orphan pages.”</strong>  

Simple but powerful fixes:

- Maximize exposure of <strong>“important pages”</strong> in the menu/footer.  
- Naturally link to other articles or service pages within the body text.  
- Organize category/tag pages to link related posts together.  

Internal linking affects both indexing speed and priority simultaneously.

<br/>

## 8. Test Server Response Speed and Errors (4xx, 5xx)

Search engines communicate with your server. If responses are slow or error-prone, they tend to move on.

Checkpoints:

- Are there many 4xx or 5xx errors in Search Console → Indexing → Pages?  
- Does TTFB (Time to First Byte) significantly exceed 1 second in PageSpeed/Monitoring tools?  
- Does the bot frequently encounter 500, 503, or timeouts?  

Some <strong>“Discovered – currently not indexed”</strong> cases occur because a server is too weak, causing Google to slow down crawling intentionally.  

For a new site, re-evaluate hosting specs and caching settings.

<br/>

## 9. Build Small-Scale External Links and Mentions

Another axis affecting indexing speed is <strong>“Trust.”</strong>

- Even for a new site, having just a few links from other sites or communities makes Google want to check it out faster than a <strong>“complete unknown.”</strong>  

Realistic actions:

- Link to the new site from other sites or blogs you operate.  
- Post useful content in relevant communities and naturally include a source link.  
- Add the URL to introduction sections on GitHub, Notion, or portfolio pages.  

Buying backlinks is high risk. However, introducing your site from <strong>“assets you already own”</strong> is safe and effective.

<br/>

## 10. Re-request Indexing and Create a Monitoring Routine

Finally, talk about routines. Indexing isn't a one-time event with a button click.

A realistic routine:

- Weekly: Check the Search Console Indexing > Pages report.  
  - Audit newly appeared <strong>“Discovered/Crawled – not indexed”</strong> URLs.  
- Manually request indexing for core pages immediately after publishing.  
- Monthly: Take a screenshot of `site:example.com` search results to track progress.  

Remember these timelines:

- Completely new domain:  
  - Days to weeks for the first index.  
  - 1–3 months for stable indexing and exposure is common.  

Once technical blockages are cleared, what remains is <strong>“consistency.”</strong> Neither Google nor tools can do this for you.

<br/>

## Realistic Checklist Summary

Follow this workflow for results:

<strong>Phase 1 (Do it today)</strong>  
- Check indexing status with `site:domain`.  
- Audit robots.txt / noindex / private settings.  
- Register Search Console and complete authentication.  

<strong>Phase 2 (Within 1-2 days)</strong>  
- Submit sitemap.xml.  
- Manually request indexing for 3–10 core pages.  
- Identify <strong>“Discovered – currently not indexed”</strong> pages.  

<strong>Phase 3 (Within 1-2 weeks)</strong>  
- Clean up thin/duplicate pages and enhance core content.  
- Fix internal links (eliminate orphan pages).  
- Review server speed and error logs.  

<strong>Phase 4 (1-3 month routine)</strong>  
- Regularly monitor Search Console metrics and indexing status.  
- Request indexing for all new major pages at launch.  
- Gradually and steadily increase external links and mentions.  

Asking <strong>“Why isn't it appearing after 2 weeks?”</strong> is a bit unfair to Google.  

Focus on what you can control. Once indexing starts, shift your energy toward content and conversion. Once the gears start turning, it gets much easier.
