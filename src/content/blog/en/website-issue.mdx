You hit the "Launch" button.  
But strangely, it's silent.  
No traffic, no inquiries, no sales.

In most cases, the problem isn't <strong>"lack of advertising,"</strong> but rather a hole in the basic checklist.

## What This Article Covers

- The 12 most common problems encountered after making a website.
- Rearranged problems based on <strong>"Importance + Resolution Order."</strong>
- Checkpoints and examples you can immediately audit at each stage.

<br/>

## The 12 Steps at a Glance

1. Verifying if Domain and SSL are actually working normally  
2. Checking if loading speed (especially mobile) holds up  
3. Auditing if the core page structure is tangled  
4. Ensuring fonts, colors, and buttons are visible and clickable for users  
5. Testing if forms (inquiry, signup, payment) actually arrive  
6. Setting up basic SEO (Title, Description, OG Tags)  
7. Monitoring if indexing (search visibility) is in progress  
8. Verifying if logs, analytics, and conversion tracking are coming in correctly  
9. Implementing minimum security and backups  
10. Organizing operations processes (content publishing, editing, deployment)  
11. Checking for mandatory legal information and policies  
12. Running an actual user feedback loop  

Check these in order from top to bottom.  
If you try to <strong>"Fix all 12 at once,"</strong> you'll just burn out.

<br/>

## 1. Verifying if Domain and SSL are Actually Working Normally

If this isn't working, everything else is an illusion.

- Does it automatically redirect to https even if accessed via http?  
- Does the lock icon (Secure) appear in the address bar?  
- Does the subdomain (www / non-www) lead consistently to one side?  

Common real-world cases:

- `example.com` works, but `www.example.com` returns a 404.  
- <strong>"Not Secure"</strong> warnings appear only on mobile.  
- Shopping cart or login pages strangely downgrade to http.  

These are penalty factors for search engines as well.  
It's better to spend an hour early on to get this sorted.

<br/>

## 2. Checking if Loading Speed (Especially Mobile) Holds Up

![High-tech infrastructure representing performance and security](/images/website_issue_infrastructure_ssl_speed_1770860355595.png)

3 seconds.  
The amount of time people are willing to wait.

- Some analyses show bounce rates jump up to 32% if loading takes more than 3 seconds.  
- The feeling is worse in mobile data environments.  

At minimum, check these:

- Verify mobile scores with PageSpeed Insights / Lighthouse.  
- Check TTFB and LCP times for the first page (Home, key landing, product details).  
- Audit for repetitive use of large images (over 1MB).  

When you feel like money is leaking from your ads, it's often a speed problem, not a traffic problem.

<br/>

## 3. Auditing if the Core Page Structure is Tangled

The situation where the menu exists, but users can't find it.

- Can a visitor understand <strong>"what this site does"</strong> within 15 seconds?  
- Is the structure designed so primary actions (inquiry, purchase, signup) are within 3 clicks?  
- Are important pages invisible in menus, footers, or body links?  

Structural problems seen in practice:

- All menus are buried inside dropdowns.  
- <strong>"Service Intro,"</strong> <strong>"Solutions,"</strong> and <strong>"Platform"</strong> are separate names but lead to identical content.  
- Blog posts are written diligently, but have zero links to service pages.  

Close your eyes and try drawing your menu on paper.  
Deleting just a few lines often makes the flow much smoother.

<br/>

## 4. Ensuring Fonts, Colors, and Buttons are Visible and Clickable

This isn't an aesthetic issue; it's a survival issue.

- Font size: Minimum 16px for body text; 17–18px recommended for mobile.  
- Contrast: Is there enough lightness difference between text and background? (Avoid light gray on dark gray).  
- Buttons: Have <strong>"only one"</strong> action button stand out clearly on a single screen.  

Situations common in early sites:

- Text readability is destroyed while trying to emphasize background images.  
- Button colors are indistinguishable from link colors (users don't know where to click).  
- Mobile line spacing is too tight, leading users to give up.  

Step 3 meters back from your screen.  
You'll immediately see what actually stands out. (It sounds like a joke, but it really works).

<br/>

## 5. Testing if Forms (Inquiry, Signup, Payment) Actually Arrive

The hole everyone falls into at least once.

- The customer sent the form.  
- The screen shows <strong>"Sent successfully."</strong>  
- But it's nowhere to be found in the inbox, CRM, or Slack.  

This problem approaches silently in the form of <strong>"zero inquiries."</strong>

What to check:

- Test inquiry/signup/payment forms 3–5 times with real data.  
- Ensure incoming emails aren't landing in the spam folder.  
- Check if redirect or "thank you" pages appear correctly after submission.  
- Keep only necessary fields to reduce the mid-way dropout rate.  

Missing just one inquiry a day is 30 in a month.  
Translated into revenue, that's a painful number.

<br/>

## 6. Setting Up Basic SEO (Title, Description, OG Tags)

This isn't "advanced" SEO; it's <strong>"common sense"</strong> setup.

- Does each page have a unique `<title>` and meta description?  
- Is a representative thumbnail (OG image) set?  
- Does an H1 tag appear once per page, including key keywords?  

Frequent mistakes:

- Every page title is <strong>"Company Name | HOME."</strong>  
- Blog titles are completely different from actual `<title>` tags.  
- No OG image, causing social shares to pick up random images.  

While long-term SEO needs depth, just <strong>"doing titles, descriptions, and thumbnails right"</strong> makes a massive difference at launch.

<br/>

## 7. Monitoring if Indexing (Search Visibility) is in Progress

A stage where new domains often get stuck.

- When searching with `site:example.com`:  
  - Is only the homepage visible?  
  - Are individual pages like blogs or services slowly appearing?  
- Are there many crawl errors or <strong>"Not Indexed"</strong> statuses in Search Console?  

Typical patterns:

- 1–2 weeks post-launch: Many pages reflect <strong>"Discovered – currently not indexed."</strong>  
- 1–3 months: Indexing expands gradually, starting with important pages.  
- Speed varies depending on domain trust and internal link structure.  

What you can do at this stage:

- Inspect key URLs (Services, Pricing, Top posts) and request indexing.  
- Verify Sitemap (XML) submission.  
- Avoid mass-producing duplicate or thin pages.  

Search engines are slower and pickier than you think.  
To reduce anxiety, you need a <strong>"status-check routine."</strong>

<br/>

## 8. Verifying if Logs, Analytics, and Conversion Tracking are Coming In

![Analytics dashboard for data-driven decisions and feedback loops](/images/website_issue_analytics_feedback_loop_1770860374365.png)

Without data, you're operating on "gut feelings."  
And gut feelings are usually wrong.

- Is GA4 / Matomo / Plausible analytics installed?  
- Are key events (scroll, button click, form submission, checkout) tracked?  
- Are you distinguishing traffic sources using UTM parameters?  

Scenes often witnessed in practice:

- Spending money on ads but not knowing which channel is efficient.  
- Knowing <strong>"20 inquiries this month"</strong> but not knowing which page contributed.  
- No heatmap or session replay tools, so drop-off points are invisible.  

You don't need to be perfect from day one.  
But at minimum, make sure you can see <strong>"who came how far and where they left."</strong>

<br/>

## 9. Implementing Minimum Security and Backups

Hacking arrives silently and unpleasantly.

- Apply two-factor authentication (2FA) to admin accounts.  
- Automate regular backups (daily or weekly).  
- Secure a routine for updating plugins, themes, and libraries.  

Security accidents common in early sites:

- Using the default <strong>"admin"</strong> account.  
- Leaving test subdomains open, exposed to vulnerability scanning.  
- Zero backups, meaning one tangle requires starting from scratch.  

A website is less like a <strong>"home"</strong> and more like a <strong>"store."</strong>  
You need a nightly routine of closing the shutters and checking the locks to last.

<br/>

## 10. Organizing Operations Processes (Content, Editing, Deployment)

Surprisingly many sites run in a structure where <strong>"only one person can fix the source."</strong>

- Who has what authority to edit?  
- How are changes tested and reflected on the live server?  
- Is there a way to roll back in case of a mistake?  

Common examples:

- WordPress/No-Code Builders:  
  - 1 Admin, several Editor accounts.  
  - Edit on a staging (preview) site first before pushing to live.  
- Code-based (Next.js, Django, etc.):  
  - Git branch strategy (e.g., main / develop).  
  - PR reviews and staging deployment before production.  

Without an organized process, you'll never escape the fear that <strong>"one mistake will wipe out all traffic."</strong>

<br/>

## 11. Checking for Mandatory Legal Information and Policies

This part is quite sensitive, especially regarding local regulations.

- Display business info (Company name, CEO, Registration number, Address, Contact).  
- Privacy Policy / Terms of Use.  
- Clearly state refund/exchange policies if it's e-commerce.  
- Notice on cookie usage and tracking (banner or policy page).  

Running ads while these are missing can lead to sudden correction orders.

Even if you think <strong>"I don't even have sales yet,"</strong> preparing basic documents early saves time in the long run.

<br/>

## 12. Running an Actual User Feedback Loop

The last part is about people, not numbers.

- Do you have a channel to directly ask your first 10 users? (Email, Chat, Discord, etc.)  
- Is there a feedback collection mechanism (simple survey, satisfaction, bug report) on the site?  
- How do you organize received feedback and set priorities?  

Common misunderstandings:

- <strong>"I don't have traffic yet, so I can't get feedback."</strong>  
  → Sit down with just 5 acquaintances for 30 minutes of screen sharing, and you'll find 20 things to improve.  

- <strong>"I'm afraid opening a bug report channel will lead to only complaints."</strong>  
  → Bugs exist anyway. It's better to find out and fix them than to stay in the dark.  

A single line of frustration from a user is often more accurate than a three-hour meeting with three planners. Truly.

<br/>

## Don't Try to Do All 12 at Once

Here is a realistic summary of the order:

<strong>Phase 1:</strong>  
- Domain/SSL  
- Form functionality  
- Loading speed (Mobile focus)

<strong>Phase 2:</strong>  
- Core page structure  
- Buttons/Typography  
- Basic SEO tags

<strong>Phase 3:</strong>  
- Indexing status monitoring  
- Logs/Conversion tracking  
- Security/Backup

<strong>Phase 4:</strong>  
- Operations processes  
- Mandatory legal info  
- User feedback loop

By breaking it into these 4 chunks and tackling one per day, you can build a solid foundation within a week.

A website isn't an object you make once and finish.  
But starting strong significantly slows down the rate of future headaches.  
<strong>"You're going to have trouble, so let's have less of it"</strong>—that's the perfect mindset for using this checklist.
