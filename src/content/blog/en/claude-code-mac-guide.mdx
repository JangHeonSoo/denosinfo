A MacBook, a Claude Pro subscription, and a Git repo. As of 2026, that combo is enough to ship a real web app without touching half the boilerplate yourself. Claude Code is no longer just a "chatbot that writes snippets" — it’s an agent that reads your repo, edits files, runs tests, starts dev servers, and opens pull requests for you.

This guide focuses on four things: what Claude Code actually is, why it’s good, how to set it up on macOS, and how to use it to build and ship a real web application end-to-end.

<br/>

## What Makes Claude Code Different

Most AI coding tools live in a chat box and spit out code fragments. Claude Code lives <em>inside</em> your codebase. It reads your Git repo, edits files, runs commands, and drives your dev tools like a junior engineer who already knows your stack.

Key capabilities:

- Terminal integration: Run Claude Code in your local terminal and let it drive your existing CLI tools (`npm`, `git`, `pytest`, etc.).
- IDE integration: Native extensions for VS Code and JetBrains show Claude’s edits as visual diffs inside your editor.
- Desktop app: The Claude desktop app’s Code tab manages multiple sessions in parallel, using Git worktrees to isolate branches per session.
- Web & iOS: You can continue Claude Code sessions from the browser or iOS app, great for long-running remote jobs.

In practice, you describe what you want, Claude scans your project, opens and edits relevant files, runs tests, and shows you a diff. You approve, and the changes land in your repo.

## Why Claude Code Is Worth Using (Five Real Advantages)

There are plenty of AI coding copilots already. Claude Code still earns a spot in the "top tier" for a few concrete reasons.

1. <strong>Project-wide understanding</strong>
   - Uses agentic search to map your project structure and dependencies without you manually curating context.
   - Handles large codebases (tens of thousands of lines) by summarizing architecture and key modules.

2. <strong>Serious multi-file refactors</strong>
   - Makes coordinated edits across many files while running build and test commands to keep things consistent.
   - Can read GitHub issues, create branches, apply fixes, run checks, and open a PR in one continuous workflow.

3. <strong>Safe review-and-approve workflow</strong>
   - In Ask permissions mode, every file edit shows up as a diff you can accept or reject before it touches disk.
   - Four permission modes (Ask, Auto accept edits, Plan, Bypass) let you dial automation up or down depending on the repo.

4. <strong>Dev server + in-app browser</strong>
   - Starts your dev server and opens an embedded browser, then clicks around, fills forms, and inspects the DOM to verify its own changes.
   - Uses <strong>.claude/launch.json</strong> to understand how to run `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, custom scripts, and which port to expect.

5. <strong>macOS-friendly with Local/Remote/SSH</strong>
   - On macOS desktop, you can choose Local, Remote, or SSH environments for each session.
   - Local sessions inherit your shell’s environment variables and tools. Remote sessions run in Anthropic’s cloud and keep going even if your Mac sleeps.

Your job shifts from "typing code" to "steering and reviewing". Claude handles the grunt work; you keep it pointed at the right problem.

<br/>

## Setting Up Claude Code on macOS

Let’s walk through a clean macOS setup.

### 1. Install Claude Desktop

1. Go to the Claude Code product page and download the desktop app for macOS.
2. Install the `.dmg` as usual and move it to your Applications folder.
3. Launch the app and sign in with a Claude Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise account to unlock the Code tab.

If you’re on a managed org, your admin can enable or disable the Code tab from the admin console.

### 2. Install core dev tools (Terminal)

On a Mac, you’ll want at least:

- Git: usually preinstalled, but verify with `git --version`.
- Node.js / npm: for web and full-stack apps.
- Homebrew: for installing other CLI tools.

```bash
# Check Git
git --version

# Install Homebrew (if needed)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install Node.js (LTS)
brew install node
```

Claude Code’s local sessions inherit your shell environment, so put PATH and API keys into `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` and restart the desktop app afterward.

### 3. Prepare a project folder

1. Create a new repo on GitHub.
2. Clone it locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/claude-web-demo.git
cd claude-web-demo
```

3. In Claude Desktop, set this directory as the <strong>Project folder</strong> when starting a Code session.

### 4. Start a Code session in Claude Desktop

1. Open the Claude desktop app and switch to the <strong>Code</strong> tab.
2. Click <strong>New session</strong> and configure four things:
   - Environment: Local
   - Project folder: your `claude-web-demo` directory
   - Model: Sonnet 4.6 or Opus 4.6
   - Permission mode: start with Ask permissions
3. For your first prompt, try something like:

```text
I want to build a simple web application using Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind.
Please initialize this repo, set up the project, and get a dev server running.
 Use best practices for directory structure and minimal boilerplate.
```

Claude will run commands like `npm init`, `npx create-next-app`, and `npm run dev`, then open a local preview to confirm everything works.

## Permission Modes: How Much Autonomy Do You Want?

Permission modes are the safety rails around Claude Code.

- Ask permissions: Claude always asks before editing files or running commands. Best for first-time use and production repos.
- Auto accept edits: File edits are applied automatically, but command execution still requires approval.
- Plan mode: Claude only analyzes and produces a plan without touching files or running anything. Great for complex refactors.
- Bypass permissions: Full autonomy — no prompts. Only safe in sandboxes, throwaway branches, or containers.

For macOS development, a sane pattern is:

1. New projects: Auto accept edits + ask before commands.
2. Sensitive production code: Ask permissions only.
3. Experimental branches or toy projects: Auto accept or Bypass.

Double-check the mode before you start. On the wrong repo, Bypass mode is how you end up letting an AI run `rm -rf` in the wrong place.

## Teaching Claude Your Project Rules with CLAUDE.md

One of Claude Code’s underrated features is the <strong>CLAUDE.md</strong> project file. It tells Claude how to behave inside a specific repo — code style, stack choices, libraries, and conventions.

Create `CLAUDE.md` in your project root and add something like:

```markdown
# Project Guidelines

- This project uses Next.js 14 + TypeScript + App Router.
- Styling must use Tailwind CSS only, no standalone CSS files.
- Components should default to server components; use 'use client' only when needed.
- Tests are written with Vitest + React Testing Library.
- Commit messages follow Conventional Commits in English.
```

From then on, Claude Code will respect these rules automatically without you repeating them in every prompt. It’s like giving your AI pair-programmer a team handbook.

## End-to-End Example: Building a Web App with Claude Code on macOS

![Visualization of High-Tech Connectivity](/images/claude-code-workflow.png)

Let’s walk through a realistic example: a simple "Todo + tags" web app built with Next.js.

### Step 1: Scaffold the project

In a Claude Code session, prompt:

```text
Create a new Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS web app.
Features:
- No login, store data in localStorage only.
- Each todo has multiple tags.
- Support filtering by tag.

Use create-next-app or a suitable template.
 Install dependencies and ensure the dev server runs.
```

Claude will:

- Run `npx create-next-app@latest`.
- Configure TypeScript and Tailwind.
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.
- Open the app in the embedded browser and verify it loads correctly.

### Step 2: Design the domain model with Plan mode

Switch to Plan mode and ask:

```text
Using Plan mode only, design the full structure for this app:
- Data types for todos and tags
- Main pages and components
- State management approach
- How to persist to localStorage

Show a step-by-step plan before implementing anything.
```

Claude will produce a detailed file-by-file plan without modifying code yet. Once it looks good, tell it to implement the plan.

### Step 3: Implement and auto-preview

Switch back to Auto accept edits and say:

```text
Now implement the plan you just created.
 Build the todo list page, tag filters, and localStorage integration.
 After each change, verify behavior in the dev server and fix any issues you find.
```

Claude will:

- Create and edit files (`app/page.tsx`, `components/TodoList.tsx`, etc.).
- Implement types, state logic, and UI.
- Start the dev server and interact with the app in the embedded browser, reading DOM and error messages to debug.

The dev server configuration will live in <strong>.claude/launch.json</strong>, which you can customize, for example:

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "web",
      "runtimeExecutable": "yarn",
      "runtimeArgs": ["dev"],
      "port": 3000
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Self-review and refactor

Once the MVP works, turn Claude into your reviewer:

```text
Review all recent changes with a focus on:
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Component boundaries

Suggest improvements and then apply the ones you recommend.
```

From the diff view, hit <strong>Review code</strong> so Claude leaves comments on potential bugs and logic issues. For changes you agree with, just ask it to apply its own suggestions.

### Step 5: Open a GitHub PR from macOS

Hook it up to GitHub so Claude can carry the work all the way to a PR.

1. Install and authenticate GitHub CLI:

```bash
brew install gh
gh auth login
```

2. Configure GitHub as a connector in the Claude desktop app.
3. In your session, say:

```text
Create a new branch for the current changes, commit with a clear message,
open a GitHub pull request, and enable auto-fix and auto-merge if CI passes.
 Summarize the PR description for human reviewers.
```

Claude will:

- Create a worktree branch for the session.
- Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
- Use `gh pr create` to open a PR.
- Monitor CI status and apply Auto-fix / Auto-merge if configured.

You keep control: review the PR, skim the diff, and hit Approve.

## macOS Claude Code Setup Checklist

Here’s a quick checklist you can literally run through on a fresh Mac:

- [ ] Install Claude Desktop for macOS and unlock the Code tab with Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise.
- [ ] Install Git, Node.js, npm, and GitHub CLI; log in to GitHub.
- [ ] Add a <strong>CLAUDE.md</strong> file in each project with stack and style rules.
- [ ] Start a Local Code session in Ask permissions mode for your first repo.
- [ ] Inspect <strong>.claude/launch.json</strong> and adjust dev server commands and ports if needed.
- [ ] Connect GitHub as a connector and test the PR workflow once.

Do this once, and new projects become a one-liner: "Set up this repo and build X." Your Mac turns into a command center where you think about products, and Claude Code handles the typing.
