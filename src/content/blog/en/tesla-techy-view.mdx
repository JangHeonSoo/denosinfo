# Tesla through an IT pro lens: end of an era, new beginning

On the morning of January 29, 2026, a link popped up in our company Slack: "Tesla Model S/X discontinued."

My stomach sank.

I do not remember if it was 2020 or 2021, but I clearly remember the day I ordered a Model 3 the moment it launched in Korea. People around me said, "Why an EV?" and "There are no chargers," but I was sure. This was the future.

Today I drive a refreshed Model X as the family car. I personally experienced the new S/X features Tesla shipped in late 2025. I used to work on big data and AI at a major company and now work as a PM, but I still see the world through technology. This discontinuation is not just a product change. It is a paradigm shift.

## A flagship's honorable retirement: the numbers are brutal

Elon Musk called it an "honorable discharge."

But numbers are ruthless.

In Q4 2025, Tesla delivered 418,227 vehicles in total. The "Other Models" category, which includes Model S and X, fell 51% year over year. That is a straight halving. Annually, Tesla delivered 1,636,129 vehicles. S and X were about 50,000 units, just 3% of the total.

Model 3 and Model Y alone account for more than 97%.

Even more shocking: Tesla's 2025 annual revenue was $94.8B, down 3% year over year. That was its first annual revenue decline. Net income fell 46% to $3.8B, about 30% of its 2022 peak of $12.6B.

Demand for premium flagships did not simply vanish. The market is being reshaped.

Meanwhile, BYD sold 2.26M vehicles in 2025 and overtook Tesla's 1.64M to become the world's No. 1 EV maker. While Tesla fell 9%, BYD grew 28%.

## Fremont's transformation in Q2 2026: from cars to robots

"Starting next quarter, we will gradually halt Model S/X production, effectively stopping it. We are moving to a future based on autonomy."

Musk was clear.

The Model S/X lines at the Fremont factory will stop completely by the end of Q2 2026 (estimated June 30). In their place will be the production line for the humanoid robot Optimus.

The target is one million units per year.

At first I thought, "One million? That's crazy." But then I remembered how Musk operates: he throws out impossible numbers and makes them real. Who believed reusing rockets was possible? Or that EVs could beat supercars?

Optimus is a 173 cm, 56 kg lightweight humanoid. It can lift up to 20 kg, move at 8 km/h, and run all day on a 2.3 kWh battery.

The price matters most. Production cost is estimated at $20K-$30K (about KRW 28-43M). Compared to Boston Dynamics' Atlas, which costs hundreds of thousands, that is disruptive.

Tesla plans to start internal production by late 2026 and commercial sales in 2027.

## Tesla's strategy through a PM lens: data is the moat

I am a PM now, but I used to work on big data and AI. I see how strategic this decision is.

Tesla is not a car company. It is a data company.

### 1. Tesla vehicles as a real-time data platform

More than five million Teslas on the road collect over 50B miles of driving data each year (about 80B km). That is 100K miles per minute. This feeds FSD (Full Self-Driving) training.

What about competitors?

Waymo uses LiDAR and HD maps to map roads down to centimeters. It is safe, but not scalable. Every new city requires months of mapping and testing.

Tesla uses pure vision. Like humans, the AI understands the road from camera footage alone. It scales because software updates can deploy globally.

Musk's quote is true: "The road system was designed for eyes."

### 2. Vertical integration: from batteries to AI chips

Tesla builds batteries, AI chips, the body, and software in-house.

- **Battery**: 4680 cells produced at Giga Texas. As of June 2024, over 50M cells produced, 126,050 per day.
- **AI chips**: D1 and D2 chips power the Dojo supercomputer for real-time training.
- **Manufacturing**: Giga casting cuts parts and lowers production cost by 40%.

Why does this matter?

Traditional automakers source parts across countries and suppliers. The supply chain is long, expensive, and slow to innovate.

Tesla handles raw materials to finished vehicle in a single factory. Giga Shanghai was the first factory enabling one-pass production from battery cells to Model 3/Y assembly. It runs with 1/5 the headcount of Fremont (about 2,000 people) and was built in a year.

That is Tesla's edge.

### 3. FSD evolution: end-to-end neural networks

In late 2025, our Model X received FSD v14.1.4.

At first I thought, "Full self-driving? Sounds exaggerated." After using it, I was shocked.

FSD v14 uses a neural network with 10x more parameters than earlier versions. It recognizes speed limit signs, slows at speed bumps, and naturally avoids stopped vehicles.

FSD's launch in Korea was a big deal. On November 23, 2025, Tesla officially released FSD in Korea for HW4 Model S/X built in North America.

Why only S/X?

The Korea-US FTA. North American-built vehicles can be imported under US safety standards faster than Shanghai-built Model 3/Y.

The real point is different: FSD v14 handles dense Seoul traffic. Narrow alleys, aggressive merging, chaotic intersections. It works because of data.

Tesla trains on real driving data from real cars. Not synthetic, not simulation. Actual roads and actual people.

## Robotaxi and Optimus: Tesla's true target

Tesla is no longer just a car company. It is an AI and robotics company.

### Robotaxi: target coverage of 1/4 to 1/2 of the US by 2026

Musk said Tesla will operate robotaxi services in 1/4 to 1/2 of the US by late 2026. Trials are running in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, with expansion in H1 2026 to Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Las Vegas.

The dedicated Cybercab robotaxi is expected to start production in April 2026.

The key is decentralization. Owners can enroll their cars into the robotaxi network, let the car pick up riders, and share the revenue. It is a model that disrupts Uber and Lyft.

Morgan Stanley forecasts Tesla operating 1M robotaxis by 2035. The global robotaxi market is expected to exceed $45B by 2030.

### Optimus: "the biggest product in human history"

Musk called Optimus "the biggest product in human history."

Is that hype?

Consider economics: a $100K robot running 24 hours a day for five years costs about $5.71 per hour (around KRW 8,200), cheaper than Korea's minimum wage (KRW 10,320).

Industrial robots already exist. Humanoid robots are different. They are human-shaped, so they fit existing infrastructure: stairs, doors, tools.

Tesla says it already uses Optimus for "simple tasks" inside factories, aiming for meaningful output by late 2026.

The consumer market is also in sight: watering plants, organizing groceries, caring for children. At $20K, a middle-class household could buy one.

## A painful lesson: FSD subscription vs upfront, and Feb 14, 2026

I bought FSD upfront.

I thought, "I will use it for life, so pay once." Then Musk announced that starting Feb 14, 2026, the one-time FSD purchase option would end.

Only subscriptions remain.

Why?

Tesla is shifting to software revenue. Subscriptions are more stable than one-time sales. Musk also said FSD could be worth $100K once it reaches full autonomy.

Tesla's Services & Other revenue (FSD subscriptions, insurance, Supercharging, etc.) grew 18% in 2025. Vehicle sales fell 11%, while software revenue rose.

That is Tesla's real face.

## Tesla's true edge through a big data/AI lens

When I worked in big data and AI, the most important thing was data quality.

No matter how good the algorithm, garbage data yields garbage results (Garbage In, Garbage Out).

Tesla's edge is exactly here.

### 1. Real-world driving data vs synthetic data

Tesla collects labeled data from over five million cars. This is real driving data, so the AI learns to drive like a human.

Competitors use simulation or synthetic data, but simulations cannot fully represent reality.

Take Korea: motorcycles weaving between cars, taxis cutting in, jaywalking pedestrians. These are hard to simulate.

Tesla learns these from real data.

### 2. Edge-case collection system

While using FSD, the car occasionally behaves oddly. Tesla sends that data back to HQ. These are "edge cases": rare but critical.

Tesla retrains on edge cases. That is the data flywheel: more cars produce more data, data improves AI, better AI sells more cars, and the loop accelerates.

### 3. Dojo supercomputer: training speed matters

Tesla runs its own AI supercomputer, Dojo. D1 and D2 chips train on real-time vehicle data.

The bottleneck was compute. Musk admitted Tesla could only train on part of collected data due to limited compute power.

So Tesla invested $500M in 2024 to expand Dojo at the New York Gigafactory and added tens of thousands of GPUs in Texas.

Tesla can now train faster.

## What I learned later: Tesla is a manufacturing innovation company

If you see Tesla only as an EV maker, you miss a lot.

Tesla is a manufacturing innovation company.

### Giga casting: the magic of fewer parts

Traditional cars assemble hundreds of parts with welding, bolts, and rivets.

Tesla uses giga casting to cast the entire body in one go, reducing parts, shortening production time, and cutting costs by 40%.

This is possible because Tesla built its own massive die-casting machines (Giga Press).

### Full automation: 95% automation at Giga Shanghai

Giga Shanghai is 95% automated. Welding, painting, assembly, and inspection are all robotic.

Tesla installed hundreds of industrial robots from KUKA and FANUC, and uses software-driven robot carts instead of conveyor belts.

The result: 1/5 the workforce compared to Fremont, and completion in one year.

### The tent factory paradox: process design beats automation

When Tesla hit Model 3 production hell, it built a "tent factory" in a parking lot and assembled cars manually.

It worked. The tent factory produced 20% of Model 3 output.

Musk said the tent factory was more effective than a fixed building.

Why? Process design matters more. Even with the same equipment, flow, inventory placement, and takt design can swing productivity. Tesla empowered floor engineers to adjust layouts daily or weekly, which was the key.

## Risks: will it really work?

Honestly, I am uneasy.

### 1. Optimus is not in mass production yet

Musk says Tesla will reach "meaningful production" by late 2026. But today, there are zero Optimus robots deployed in factories.

We hear it does "simple tasks," but there are no performance metrics.

Boston Dynamics and Hyundai target 30,000 units per year. Tesla's goal of 1,000,000 is 33x higher.

Is it realistic?

### 2. Musk's timelines are always late

Cybertruck was announced in 2019 and delivered in 2023, four years late.

Full self-driving has been "next year" since 2016. As of 2026, it is still supervised.

Optimus sales in 2027 may also slip.

### 3. Intensifying competition: BYD and Chinese brands

BYD overtook Tesla in 2025 to become the world's top EV maker.

BYD's strength is price. It sells cheaper yet remains profitable through vertical integration and domestic supply chains.

Tesla sales in Europe fell 40% over 11 months in 2025. Some analysts blamed Musk's political activity for harming the brand.

## Still, why I remain a Teslam

When I drive the Model X on the highway and see FSD change lanes, adjust speed, and pass toll gates, I still feel amazed.

"It actually works."

The shock I felt when I first drove a Model 3 in 2020 (or 2021) is still vivid.

The car kept improving through software updates. You wake up and the car has learned new tricks.

That is Tesla's charm.

Tesla does not just sell "electric cars." It sells the future.

Whether that future is robotaxis, Optimus, or something we do not yet know, Tesla keeps evolving.

## Closing: Tesla's real value through an IT pro lens

One thing I learned as a PM:

Execution matters more than strategy.

Great ideas mean nothing without delivery.

Tesla executes.

- Mass-produced EVs: done
- Self-driving: in progress
- Robotaxi: started
- Humanoid robots: next

The end of Model S/X is not an ending. It is a beginning.

An era is ending, and a new one is starting.

I believe buying that Model 3 in 2020 (or 2021) was the right call, and I do not regret driving a Model X today.

If, ten years from now, we live with Optimus and commute in robotaxis, I will say:

"I have been a Teslam since 2020."
