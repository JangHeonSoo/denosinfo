# How an 8B Model Just Beat GPT-4o

A paper dropped in Nature last week. **OpenScholar**, an open-source AI, outperformed **GPT-4o** on computer science questions. 51% accuracy versus 45%. Six percentage points might not sound like much. But in AI benchmarks, it's huge.

## How Small Models Beat Giants

**OpenScholar** came from the **Allen Institute for AI** (Ai2) and five universities working together. It searches through 45 million open-access papers. Multiple papers at once. That's a completely different approach from traditional LLMs that scan one paper at a time.

Here's the clever part: it critiques itself before finalizing answers. This self-verification loop slashed those notorious "hallucinated citations." And boy, **fake citations** have become academia's headache lately.

## 100+ Ghost Citations Found at NeurIPS

**GPTZero** dropped a bombshell analysis earlier this year. Over 100 papers at **NeurIPS 2025** contained AI-generated fake citations. These papers survived a 24.52% acceptance rate. They fooled 3-5 peer reviewers each.

**ICLR 2026** submissions? Same story. 50+ hallucinations caught.

One researcher described the nightmare perfectly: "A ghost reference gets cited by a real paper. That paper goes online. An LLM finds it and thinks 'oh this must be real' and cites it again." A vicious feedback loop.

## A $152 Million Bet

Money is pouring into **Ai2**. Last August, **NSF** and **Nvidia** invested $152 million. The first major U.S. government investment in AI software infrastructure.

Paul Allen (Microsoft co-founder) started this research institute back in 2014. Unlike **OpenAI** or **Anthropic**, **Ai2** opens everything. Weights, training data, code, evaluation tools. All for the sake of "reproducible research."

Professor Min-Yen Kan from the National University of Singapore nailed it: "**GPT-5** might be better now. But it's not peer-reviewed. That's why open-source research matters."

## DR Tulu-8B: The 8-Billion Parameter Underdog

November brought **DR Tulu-8B**. The first open model trained for long-form deep research reports. Head-to-head with **OpenAI**'s **Deep Research**? Matched or exceeded it. With just 8 billion parameters.

The secret sauce is **RLER**—Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics. Evaluation criteria evolve alongside the model. No fixed rubric. The standards upgrade as the model learns.

Across four benchmarks in science, healthcare, and general domains, **DR Tulu** crushed existing open models by 8-42 percentage points. Cost per query? Way cheaper.

## The Question for Developers

In 2026, when "AI writes 40%+ of code," what should we trust?

**OpenScholar** and **DR Tulu-8B** make one thing crystal clear. Size isn't everything. Small models fine-tuned for specific domains beat giants. **AT&T**'s Chief Data Officer Andy Markus said it: "Fine-tuned **SLM**s will be the big trend in 2026."

But there's a flip side. MIT researcher Katherine Collins worries about "deskilling." If summarizing papers becomes too easy, young scientists might never learn to read deeply. Ironically, as AI advances, human fundamentals matter more.

## Conclusion!!

1. **OpenScholar** beat **GPT-4o** – 51% vs 45% accuracy on CS questions, proving open-source can compete
2. Hallucinated citations are everywhere – 100+ found in **NeurIPS 2025** papers alone
3. Small models fight back – **DR Tulu-8B** (8B params) matches **OpenAI Deep Research**; fine-tuned **SLM**s are the future
