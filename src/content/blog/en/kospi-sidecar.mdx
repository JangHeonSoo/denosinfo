# KOSPI Sidecar Activation

The KOSPI soared relentlessly. I wasn't particularly fond of the domestic market, so I just watched from the sidelines. 2,000... 3,000... 4,000... 5,000..???

Damn, I should've bought in lol.

Today (February 2nd), the stock market is in chaos. The sidecar was triggered.

## What Happened That Day

At 9 AM, the KOSPI opened at 5,122 points—down 1.95% from the previous day. It briefly rallied around 10 AM, but then the real collapse began in the afternoon.

It was just past noon. 12:31:12 PM.

The Korea Exchange announced the activation of a sell-side sidecar on the securities market. The first this year. Just four trading days ago, the KOSPI was dancing above the 5,000 mark. In merely four days, it crashed below that threshold.

At one point during the session, it plummeted to 4,933 points—a drop exceeding 5%. The closing price? 4,953 points. Down -5.19% from the previous day.

## What is a Sidecar Anyway?

A sidecar is a temporary suspension of program trading orders. In simple terms: "Wait, stop!"

The stock market isn't just people trading. Institutions and foreign investors mostly trade using computer programs. Pre-coded algorithms automatically place and cancel orders. This is called program trading.

The problem arises when these programs all move in the same direction simultaneously. When futures market prices plunge more than 5%, the spot market (the stock market we trade in) also falls into panic.

So when the KOSPI200 futures price drops 5% or more from the previous day and sustains that decline for one minute? Sidecar activation. From that moment, program sell orders are suspended for five minutes. Even if computers hit the "sell" button, it won't execute.

A circuit breaker(Circuit Breaker) is the extreme measure that halts the entire stock market. If the KOSPI crashes 8% or more from the previous day, Stage 1 is triggered, and all trading stops for 20 minutes. At 15%, Stage 2 kicks in. At 20%, Stage 3 ends trading for the day.

The sidecar is a milder measure—a buffer to prevent futures market shocks from cascading into the spot market. It only pauses program trading temporarily; individual investors can still buy and sell.

But today, even the sidecar couldn't stop the bleeding.

## Why the Sidecar Was Triggered: A Name Called Kevin Warsh

The night before (February 1st), President Trump dropped a bombshell.

He nominated Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve Board Governor, as the next Fed Chair.

Warsh served as a Fed Governor from 2006 to 2011, and his stance during that time was uncompromisingly hawkish. He resigned in strong opposition to Quantitative Easing(QE) policies, criticizing the Fed for "artificially keeping interest rates too low and accumulating government debt." A textbook hawk.

Hawks prioritize inflation control. They believe in keeping interest rates high even if it means cooling the economy. Doves, on the other hand, prioritize economic growth and advocate for lower rates.

The market judged Warsh solely on his past track record. "Ah, if this guy becomes Chair, rate cuts are off the table."

So what happened?

Dollar strength. If rates don't fall, the dollar's value rises. Indeed, the KRW/USD exchange rate surged to 1,451 won.

Precious metals crash. Gold and silver plummeted 8% and 25%, respectively. When interest rates are high, non-yielding assets like gold lose their appeal.

Stock market plunge. The Korean stock market took a direct hit. Foreign investors dumped ₩2.18 trillion worth of stocks. Institutions sold ₩1.27 trillion.

Only retail investors stood alone, buying ₩3.31 trillion. But it wasn't enough.

## Is Warsh Really a Hawk?

Actually, labeling Warsh a pure hawk is complicated.

Recently, he criticized the Fed for being "excessivity tight." That's a departure from his past hawkish stance. Experts view Warsh as a supply-side economist—someone who believes in lowering inflation not by suppressing demand, but by increasing corporate investment and productivity to boost supply.

If that's the case, he might actually favor deregulation + rate cuts to create a business-friendly environment. Investment banks like Goldman Sachs believe that "Warsh could cut rates 2-3 times in 2026 if he becomes Chair."

Then why did the market panic?

Uncertainty. No one knows exactly which path Warsh will take. Moreover, he's someone who has criticized the Fed for the past 15 years. There could be significant internal resistance. Deutsche Bank pointed out: "The Fed Chair has only one vote in the FOMC. If he alienates fellow members, pushing through unilateral policies will be difficult."

In short, the market reacted first to the fear of "we don't know what this guy will do."

## Even Semiconductor Giants Collapsed

The KOSPI's plunge was driven primarily by semiconductor blue chips.

Samsung Electronics: -5.79%  
SK Hynix: -7.76%

Other major market-cap stocks also bled: Hyundai Motor (-5.30%), Samsung Electronics Pref (-6.56%), LG Energy Solution (-4.52%), Hanwha Aerospace (-7.00%), SK Square (-12.28%).

Throughout January, the KOSPI enjoyed an unprecedented rally. On January 22nd, the KOSPI broke the 5,000 barrier for the first time in history—just 87 days after crossing 4,000. Samsung Electronics touched 160,000 won intraday, and SK Hynix hit 930,000 won.

Brokerage firms projected KOSPI targets of 5,500 to 6,000. The consensus was: "This isn't a bubble because earnings support it."

But that rally lasted less than two weeks before crumbling.

## The HBM Super Cycle Was the Backdrop

In fact, the KOSPI's breakthrough to 5,000 had solid fundamentals.

The explosion in HBM(High Bandwidth Memory) demand. AI data centers are hoarding Nvidia chips, and those chips require HBM. SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics effectively dominate the global HBM market.

The HBM market in 2026 is projected to reach approximately ₩29 trillion—more than double year-over-year growth. SK Hynix posted a record operating profit of ₩47 trillion in 2025, overtaking Samsung Electronics for the first time.

This boom created the memory super cycle, and the KOSPI rode that wave.

But there's a catch. Producing HBM requires three times the wafers needed for standard DRAM. As HBM production increases, conventional DRAM production capacity decreases. Limited supply drives up prices, which in turn boosts earnings.

However, this could be a temporary phenomenon. By 2027-2028, AI server investment growth is likely to slow. When Micron starts mass-producing HBM in Japan in 2028, competition will intensify.

Some in the securities industry are saying: "Enjoy 2026, but escape in 2027."

## Retail Bought, Foreigners and Institutions Sold

Today's trading by investor type was starkly divided.

Foreigners: -₩2.18 trillion  
Institutions: -₩1.27 trillion  
Retail: +₩3.31 trillion

Only retail investors held the line. For the first time since the COVID-19 bull market in 2021, they net-purchased over ₩3 trillion in a single day.

Why did foreigners and institutions sell? Simple: program trading.

They employ arbitrage strategies that simultaneously trade futures and spot markets. If futures prices are lower than spot prices, they buy futures and sell spot to capture the spread—and vice versa.

On a day like today when the futures market crashes, their programs automatically dump spot holdings. That's why the moment the KOSPI200 futures dropped over 5%, a flood of program selling hit the market.

The sidecar tried to stop this by suspending program selling for five minutes. But after five minutes? The selling resumed.

## ₩50 Million Became ₩47.5 Million

On days like this, retail investors are helpless.

If you invested ₩100 million, you lost ₩5 million in a day. ₩50 million? ₩2.5 million gone. ₩10 million? ₩500,000 evaporated.

"Just yesterday, we were hitting all-time highs..."

If you can't manage the mental stress, cutting losses and exiting might be the right move. But historical cases show that markets often rebound after sidecar activations.

March 9, 2020: COVID-19 pandemic + oil price crash → sidecar triggered → KOSPI rallied to record highs afterward  
August 24, 2015: China stock market crash spillover → sidecar triggered → recovery in 2-3 months  
August 9, 2011: U.S. credit rating downgrade shock → long-term recovery followed

Of course, during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, recovery took several years.

The key question is: "Is this a temporary correction or a trend reversal?"

## What Happens Next?

The securities industry remains optimistic.

"This is just a short-term correction; the mid- to long-term uptrend holds."  
"We don't yet know how hawkish Warsh will actually be."  
"The HBM super cycle will continue throughout 2026."

But the risks are substantial:

1. AI bubble concerns: If the money Big Tech pours into AI infrastructure doesn't translate into actual profits, Korean semiconductors will suffer.
2. Persistent high exchange rates: If the KRW/USD rate breaks 1,500 won, companies with heavy dollar debt face danger.
3. Trump's tariff card: If tariff pressures intensify before the midterm elections, Samsung and Hynix will take direct hits.
4. Fed policy uncertainty: If Warsh actually halts rate cuts, global liquidity will tighten.

Ultimately, the variable is the United States. The Fed Chair confirmation hearing, FOMC meeting outcomes, Trump's next moves—all directly impact the Korean stock market.

## Closing Thoughts

Today will be recorded as the first sidecar activation of the year.

Before the euphoria of breaking KOSPI 5,000 could even fade, the market showed us reality.

There's no such thing as "absolute safety" in the stock market. Yesterday's all-time high can become today's loss.

Yet history tells us: Buy on fear, sell on greed.

Whether this is a moment of fear or a genuine signal of trend reversal, only time will tell.

How will you respond?
